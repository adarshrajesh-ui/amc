# Role : Quant Trader

# Test
The test had 5 parts

## Sequences test
Fill in the blanks for sequences, problems were of slightly higher than NTSE level.

## Probability test
10 probability questions in increasing order of difficulty, with time limit of 1 min per question. They give options which aren't exact and ask you to give nearest option. They don't expect you to actually solve the hard problems(last 4), but instead give a good guess as all options are well spread.

## ZAP-N
Bunch of games testing your speed. Explained here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POU6H6udkIiRiO4ydZOz3IcshWVjkYr59-N82qrWcNk/edit by Abhiram (EE20)

This site has resources for acing the ZAP-N test.

Practice the same tests here: https://openquant.co/math-game

## 80 in 8
80 arithmetic problems in 8 minutes, scoring around 60 should be enough

## ZAP-P
Annoying personality test

# Interview Round 1
Read the document provided by Optiver thoroughly before hand. Understanding of what market making is essential.

First they made us play a market making game. It has 5 rounds and we make an upper and lower bid for every round. If the actual value is within the upper and lower bound, our score increases by lower bound/upper bound. There was no strict time limit, but I think I took less than a minute per question and he was fine with it.

These type of questions are called Fermi questions. 

### Example Market making
Make a market on size of IIT Madras campus in acres.

I put a bid price(upper bound) of 700 acres and an ask price(lower bound) of 500 acres.

The actual area is within the range 500 to 700 acres, hence I get 500/700 points for this round. 

I practiced market making on these sites:
1.https://www.tradermath.org/market-games/market-taking-game/lobby
2.https://www.tradinginterview.com/2-important-market-making-games-for-trading-interviews/

I've remade the questions so you can play it here. You need to score at least 2 points in the 5 rounds to win this game.

### Q1

Make a market on the sum of the first 100 prime numbers.

### Q2

Make a market on the expected number of rolls of a dice to see every face at least once.

<details hide>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  14.7
  For this question, I informed them that I already knew the exact answer, so they changed the question to this:
  Make a market on the expected number of rolls of a dice to see every face at least once and the number 6 at least twice.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  17.1 approximately

### Q3

Make a market on the number of goals scored by the player with maximum number of goals in spain's football tournament. Extra information: There are 20 teams, and each team plays another team 2 times, once in their home ground and once away.

<details hide>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Answer was in low 50s

### Q4

Can't recall rn, will add later.

### Q5

Make a market on the world record for longest duration of breath held underwater in seconds

<details hide>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  24*60 + 37
</details>


## Strategy

The general idea is to come up with a calculated guess for the value asked and then based on our confidence of our guess being right, we give an upper and lower bound, centered around our guess. 

I came up with 2 strategies:
1. Ask to Bid ratio is 2/3, need to get 3 guesses right. 

2. Ask to Bid ratio is 1/2, need to get 4 guesses right.

I went ahead with the first strategy and got only 2 guesses right, for a score of (2/3 + 4/5) = 22/15 . After the game got over, I realised that I would have scored 2 points, if I had used the second strategy.

### Dice problems

After this there were a bunch of questions about betting on dices. The interviewer would make up a game and ask me to bet on which outcome was more likely. There were 4 or 5 questions asked in this aspect in increasing order of difficulty. 

# Final Interview

## Round 1 - HR

Asked me which part of my resume I'd like to talk about. I chose to speak about my tenure as the contingent captain to the IGVC competition representing IITM. 
I was grilled on this for a solid 30 minutes. Some questions they asked:
1. What were your responsibilities as captain?
2. How did you ensure better team bonding and cooperation?
3. What would you say your biggest flaw was (as captain)?
4. If I asked your teammates what your worst quality would be, what would be their answer?
5. How did you address the problem of teammates not meeting the deadlines?
6. What is the worst decision you took as a captain? What would you have done differently?

## Round 2 - Technical 

They made me play a game which I've recreated to the best of my memory with this python simulation:
